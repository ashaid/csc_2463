### Final Integration Project - RGBiano

I created an instrument that would play notes based on buttons pressed. The joystick controls the octave and pitch. P5 displays the notes being played and an RGB visualization based on the X and Y positions of the joystick. If you click down on the joystick p5 sends the rgb value to the Arduino and it changes the led to match the color.

Hardware: buttons, joystick, RGB LED
Sound: Synth
Graphics: p5 canvas visualizing audio
